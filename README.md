# Delivery Route Optimization

## Overview
This project addresses the problem of optimizing a fuel-constrained delivery route in a city represented as a weighted undirected graph. Each delivery consists of a package that starts at a hub and must be delivered to a corresponding house. A single vehicle must deliver all packages while obeying the following constraints:

- The vehicle can only deliver to a house after visiting its corresponding hub.
- The vehicle starts with a full fuel tank and can refuel only at designated fuel stations.
- The tank has a fixed maximum capacity `f`.
- The total fuel cost (i.e., the weight of the traveled path) should be minimized.

## Input Format
```
n t m k f
h[0] h[1] ... h[n-1]        // n hub nodes
d[0] d[1] ... d[n-1]        // n destination (house) nodes
fs[0] fs[1] ... fs[k-1]     // k fuel station nodes
m lines of: a b c           // bidirectional edge between node a and b with fuel cost c
```

## Output Format
```
<length of the path>
<space-separated sequence of node indices>
```

## Compilation and Execution

Ensure the input file is located in the correct directory and the following lines in `main()` are updated accordingly:
```cpp
string inp = "tc/input_.txt";
string otp = "output/output_.txt";
```

Run the main.cpp function after changing the string names.

## Key Components

### Algorithms Used
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Computes all-pairs shortest paths and reconstructs the path using a tree matrix.
- **Greedy Heuristic**: For each hub, the algorithm attempts to greedily deliver all packages while managing fuel.
- **Simulation**: Validates the feasibility of traveling from one node to another with current fuel constraints.

### Core Functions
- `reset()`: Initializes all data structures and matrices.
- `input()`: Reads and parses the input.
- `compute_floyd()`: Builds shortest path matrices using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
- `compute_closest_fuel_station()`: For every node, computes the nearest fuel stations.
- `generate_path()`: Reconstructs the path between two nodes from the parent tree.
- `support_check()`: Checks if a path between two nodes is fuel-feasible.
- `check_path()`: Ensures the vehicle can reach a destination and still make it to a fuel station.
- `solve(int start)`: Solves the problem for a specific starting hub and tracks the minimum cost.

### Idea
For a current node, the function choses the closest node which is either an unvisited hub or a house whose hub has already been 
visited given that there is enough fuel to do so. If there is not enough fuel, the vehicle moves to the closest fuel station.

## Constraints Handled
- Ensures a house is marked delivered only after its hub is visited.
- Fuel never drops below 0; refuels only at specified stations.
- Picks optimal hub to start the delivery for minimal cost.

## Output
- Prints the number of nodes in the final delivery route.
- Outputs the full route in the correct sequence.
